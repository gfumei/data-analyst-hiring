    "The 1 GB plan shows signs of near over-utilization, with average consumption at 988 MB (99% of allowance). However, the median subscription uses only 334 MB (33% utilization), revealing a split user base where a few heavy data users hit their limits while a significant portion of subscribers use much less than their allowance. The 5 GB plan demonstrates better balance with average usage of 2.8 GB (56% utilization) and a median of 877 MB (18% utilization), indicating this plan is appropriately sized for most users. Unlimited plan subscribers clearly take advantage of their unrestricted access, consuming significantly more data and averaging 15.3 GB with a median of 3.4 GB. The key insight is that a portion of 1 GB plan subscribers should be moved to the 5 GB plan, as they are significantly over-consuming their current data allowance."

    "Based on the analysis of 5,049 subscriptions with multiple periods above 0 mb of usage, the data reveals that most subscriptions do NOT consume consistent amounts of data throughout their lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage consistency analysis shows that only 9.9% of subscribers demonstrate consistent usage patterns (CV < 0.5), while the majority exhibit high variability in their consumption. Specifically, 42.4% of subscribers show high variability (CV 1.0-2.0), 36.8% demonstrate moderate variability (CV 0.5-1.0), and 10.9% exhibit very high variability (CV > 2.0). This means that approximately 90% of subscribers have unpredictable usage patterns that vary significantly from period to period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business implications are significant. The predominance of variable usage patterns suggests that fixed-tier plans may not be optimal for most customers, creating opportunities for usage-based or flexible pricing models. The higher usage among consistent users indicates they represent the most valuable customer segment and should be prioritized for retention efforts. The steep churn rate, combined with high usage variability, suggests that many customers may be experiencing billing surprises or plan mismatches that drive them away from the service."

    "After digging into the data I believe the provided data is too limited to make any meaningful comparison between the retention among the the different plans. We have 15 full Months of data (and 17 months including partial months) for Acme Phone, so some conclusions can be drawn about it individually. However, Smart Devices has 2 months of full data and People Mobile only 1. This means we could compare retention month 2-3 between Smart Device and Acme Phone, but that is much too small of a data sample to draw any meaningful conclusion, The 1 month of complete data for People Mobile means no conclusion can be made at all."

    "**1. ACME Phone Success Factor Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the retention data showing ACME Phone's exceptional 89.3% retention rate and 7.65 average periods compared to People Mobile's 12.13% retention, there's a critical opportunity to understand what drives this 7x performance difference. I would conduct a deep-dive analysis into ACME Phone's customer journey, pricing strategy, product features, and onboarding process to identify transferable best practices. This includes analyzing their customer segmentation (given they serve 6,737 subscribers with high retention), usage patterns among their long-term subscribers, and operational processes that could be replicated across People Mobile and SmartDevices Inc. to improve their retention rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Usage Pattern and Plan Optimization Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the extreme usage variability revealed in the data (median 592 MB vs average 4,832 MB) and the severe over-utilization of the 1GB plan (248% average usage), there's a significant revenue optimization opportunity. I would analyze the correlation between usage patterns, plan selection, and retention rates across the three organizations. Specifically, investigating whether ACME Phone's superior retention is linked to better plan-usage alignment, and developing dynamic pricing models or usage-based plans that could reduce the 35.67% of 1GB subscribers who are exceeding their allowances while capturing more value from the high-usage customers driving the average up to 4.8GB."

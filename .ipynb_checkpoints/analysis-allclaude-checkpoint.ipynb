    "Based on the actual data analysis from 7,560 subscriptions, the usage patterns reveal a highly skewed distribution. The median consumption is 592 MB, meaning half of all subscriptions consume less than this amount, while the average consumption is significantly higher at 4,832 MB. This indicates that heavy users are pulling the average up substantially. The usage shows extreme variability, ranging from 0 MB to 283 GB (282,946 MB), with the average being 8.2x higher than the median, demonstrating a heavily right-skewed distribution. The coefficient of variation of 3.55 indicates extremely high variability in usage patterns across the customer base.\n",

Heavy users driving the high average represent a significant revenue opportunity for upselling, while light users may be over-provisioned, creating margin improvement opportunities. This distribution indicates that a segmented strategy is needed, as one-size-fits-all plans are suboptimal given this usage distribution. Additionally, some subscriptions show 0 MB usage, indicating potential setup issues or inactive accounts that require investigation."

    "### Analysis Results for Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis of 15,194 total subscriptions across two main plan allowances, the data reveals significant plan utilization inefficiencies and a critical mismatch between plan offerings and actual usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1GB plan (1,000 MB allowance) serves 6,737 subscriptions but shows severe over-utilization with customers consuming an average of 2,484 MB, representing 248% of their allowance. This means customers are exceeding their plan limits by more than double on average, with 35.67% of subscribers showing high utilization above 80% of their allowance. The usage range extends from 0 MB to the maximum observed usage of 283 GB, indicating this plan attracts both very light users and extremely heavy users who are clearly under-provisioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5GB plan (5,000 MB allowance) serves 8,457 subscriptions and demonstrates much better alignment with usage patterns, showing 86% average utilization of the plan allowance. Customers consume an average of 4,319 MB, which fits well within the 5GB limit. Only 15.48% of subscribers show high utilization above 80%, suggesting this plan size is more appropriately matched to customer needs, though there's still room for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dramatic difference in plan efficiency reveals critical business implications. The 1GB plan is fundamentally undersized for the majority of its users, likely resulting in overage charges, customer frustration, and potential churn. The 5GB plan shows much healthier utilization rates but may still have opportunities for segmentation, as some users are likely over-provisioned while others approach the limits. The company should consider introducing intermediate plan tiers between 1GB and 5GB, potentially at 2-3GB levels, to better capture the usage patterns of customers currently struggling with the 1GB limitation while avoiding over-provisioning others on the 5GB plan."

    "### Analysis Results for Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis of 5,049 subscriptions with multiple periods, the data reveals that most subscriptions do NOT consume consistent amounts of data throughout their lifetime, with significant implications for both retention and plan design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage consistency analysis shows that only 9.9% of subscribers demonstrate consistent usage patterns (CV < 0.5), while the majority exhibit high variability in their consumption. Specifically, 42.4% of subscribers show high variability (CV 1.0-2.0), 36.8% demonstrate moderate variability (CV 0.5-1.0), and 10.9% exhibit very high variability (CV > 2.0). This means that approximately 90% of subscribers have unpredictable usage patterns that vary significantly from period to period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there's an inverse relationship between usage consistency and volume. Consistent users consume an average of 1,130 MB per period, while moderate and high variability users consume around 980 MB, and very high variability users consume significantly less at only 495 MB. This suggests that heavier users tend to have more predictable usage patterns, while lighter users are more erratic in their consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retention analysis reveals a concerning pattern of subscriber churn over time. Starting with 8,454 subscriptions in period 1, retention drops to 76% by period 2, 51% by period 5, and only 33% by period 10. This steep decline indicates that many subscribers are not finding long-term value in the service, which may be related to the high usage variability and potential plan mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business implications are significant. The predominance of variable usage patterns suggests that fixed-tier plans may not be optimal for most customers, creating opportunities for usage-based or flexible pricing models. The higher usage among consistent users indicates they represent the most valuable customer segment and should be prioritized for retention efforts. The steep churn rate, combined with high usage variability, suggests that many customers may be experiencing billing surprises or plan mismatches that drive them away from the service."

    "### Analysis Results for Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the retention analysis across the three organizations, there are dramatic differences in project performance that reveal clear patterns in customer retention and engagement. Since we cannot definitively identify which project is \"most recent\" versus \"older\" from the available data, the analysis compares retention patterns across the three organizational projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACME Phone demonstrates exceptional retention performance with 89.3% of their 6,737 subscribers continuing past the first period, averaging 7.65 periods of engagement. This represents by far the strongest retention among all projects, suggesting either a more mature offering, better product-market fit, or superior customer onboarding and engagement strategies. The high average of 7.65 periods indicates that once customers commit to ACME Phone's service, they tend to remain long-term subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stark contrast, People Mobile shows concerning retention metrics with only 12.13% of their 734 subscribers continuing past the first period, averaging just 1.12 periods of engagement. This extremely low retention rate suggests significant challenges with their offering - potentially indicating this could be a newer project still working through product-market fit issues, pricing problems, or onboarding difficulties. The small subscriber base combined with poor retention suggests this project may be in an early or struggling phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "SmartDevices Inc. falls in the middle with 37.12% retention among 986 subscribers, averaging 1.49 periods. While significantly better than People Mobile, this retention rate is still concerning and suggests room for substantial improvement. The moderate subscriber base indicates some market traction, but the low average periods suggest customers are not finding long-term value in the offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business implications are significant. ACME Phone appears to represent the gold standard for retention and should be studied to understand what drives their success - whether it's superior product features, better pricing, stronger customer support, or more effective onboarding processes. People Mobile requires immediate attention to address retention issues before scaling further, as current metrics suggest poor unit economics and customer satisfaction. SmartDevices Inc. represents an opportunity for improvement through targeted retention initiatives. The 7x difference in retention rates between the best and worst performing projects indicates substantial variation in execution quality and suggests significant potential for knowledge transfer and process improvement across the portfolio."

    "\n",
    "Based on the retention data showing ACME Phone's exceptional 89.3% retention rate and 7.65 average periods compared to People Mobile's 12.13% retention, there's a critical opportunity to understand what drives this 7x performance difference. I would conduct a deep-dive analysis into ACME Phone's customer journey, pricing strategy, product features, and onboarding process to identify transferable best practices. This includes analyzing their customer segmentation (given they serve 6,737 subscribers with high retention), usage patterns among their long-term subscribers, and operational processes that could be replicated across People Mobile and SmartDevices Inc. to improve their retention rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Usage Pattern and Plan Optimization Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the extreme usage variability revealed in the data (median 592 MB vs average 4,832 MB) and the severe over-utilization of the 1GB plan (248% average usage), there's a significant revenue optimization opportunity. I would analyze the correlation between usage patterns, plan selection, and retention rates across the three organizations. Specifically, investigating whether ACME Phone's superior retention is linked to better plan-usage alignment, and developing dynamic pricing models or usage-based plans that could reduce the 35.67% of 1GB subscribers who are exceeding their allowances while capturing more value from the high-usage customers driving the average up to 4.8GB."
